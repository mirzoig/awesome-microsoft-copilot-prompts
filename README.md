**Why this repo exists:** Most AI prompt libraries are generic ChatGPT recycling. This collection focuses exclusively on **Microsoft Copilot** across Office 365 apps, built from real enterprise deployments and proven in production environments.

**New to Copilot?** Start with our [Quick Start Guide](prompts/QUICK-START.md) - 50 prompts that work in any Copilot (free or M365).  
**Using M365 Copilot?** Explore our 299 advanced prompts that leverage your organizational data.

## What Makes This Different

- **Copilot-Specific:** Every prompt optimized for Microsoft Copilot
- **Role-Based:** Organized by job function, not random categories
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Real prompts from production deployments, not theoretical examples
- **Zero Fluff:** No "write me a poem about spreadsheets"—these solve actual business problems

## Understanding Microsoft Copilot: Enterprise vs. M365

**Short answer:** Microsoft offers two versions of Copilot for business users, each with different capabilities.

### The Two Business Copilot Tiers

| Feature | **Copilot for Enterprise** | **M365 Copilot** |
|---------|----------------------------|------------------|
| **Access** | m365.cloud.microsoft | Embedded in Office apps |
| **Search SharePoint/OneDrive** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Access organizational files** | ✅ Yes (via upload or search) | ✅ Yes (automatic) |
| **Embedded in Office apps** | ❌ No (separate web interface) | ✅ Yes (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint, Teams) |
| **Create/edit Office files directly** | ⚠️ Limited (can analyze, can't edit) | ✅ Yes (full editing capabilities) |
| **Access emails automatically** | ❌ No (need to export/paste) | ✅ Yes (Outlook integration) |
| **Teams integration** | ⚠️ Limited (need to paste conversations) | ✅ Yes (full Teams access) |
| **Cross-app workflows** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Excel → PowerPoint → Outlook) |

**Note:** Our [Quick Start prompts](prompts/QUICK-START.md) (50 prompts) work in both tiers, plus ChatGPT and free Copilot (copilot.microsoft.com). They don't require organizational data access.

### What This Means for Our Prompts

**🟢 Quick Start Prompts (50 prompts):**
- ✅ Work in: **Both** Copilot for Enterprise **and** M365 Copilot
- No M365 data access required
- Universal prompts (writing, learning, planning, analysis)
- 👉 [View Quick Start Guide](prompts/QUICK-START.md)

**🟡 Advanced Prompts (299 prompts):**
- ⚠️ **Partially work in: Copilot for Enterprise** (with file upload workflow)
- ✅ **Fully work in: M365 Copilot** (automatic access, no adaptation needed)

### Copilot for Enterprise: What Works & What Doesn't

**✅ These Advanced Prompts WILL Work:**
- **Document analysis** - Upload files and analyze them
- **SharePoint search** - "Find all policy documents from Q3"
- **Data synthesis** - Compare multiple uploaded documents
- **Content creation** - Using uploaded files as context
- **Research workflows** - Search organizational knowledge base

**Example that works:**
```
"I've uploaded our Q3 sales reports. Analyze trends across 
all regions and identify top 3 growth opportunities."
```

**⚠️ These Advanced Prompts Have LIMITATIONS:**
- **Email analysis** - Can't access Outlook directly (need to export/paste)
- **Excel automation** - Can analyze, but can't edit Excel files directly
- **PowerPoint creation** - Can suggest content, but can't create .pptx files
- **Teams synthesis** - Can't access Teams conversations automatically
- **Cross-app workflows** - Limited (not embedded in Office apps)

**Example that won't work as written:**
```
❌ "Analyze emails from last week about Project Alpha"
(Copilot for Enterprise can't access Outlook directly)

✅ Modified for Copilot for Enterprise:
"Here are my emails from last week about Project Alpha [paste].
Analyze for key themes and action items."
```

### How to Adapt Advanced Prompts for Copilot for Enterprise

**Original M365 Copilot Prompt:**
```
"Summarize all emails from the finance team this month about 
budget overruns. Create action item list by department."
```

**Adapted for Copilot for Enterprise:**
```
"I've uploaded email exports from the finance team about budget 
overruns. Summarize key themes and create action item list by 
department based on these documents."
```

**Adaptation Pattern:**
1. **Export/download** the data you need (emails, files, Teams chats)
2. **Upload** to Copilot for Enterprise (m365.cloud.microsoft)
3. **Reference** the uploaded files in your prompt
4. **Use** the same analysis/synthesis prompts from this repo

**Common Adaptations:**

| Original M365 Prompt Phrase | Adapted for Enterprise |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| "Analyze my emails about..." | "I've uploaded emails about..." |
| "Based on our Teams discussion..." | "Based on this Teams chat export..." |
| "From my Excel file [filename]..." | "From the uploaded Excel file..." |
| "Search my Outlook for..." | "I've pasted emails below..." |
| "Review documents in SharePoint folder..." | "Search SharePoint for... [then upload results]" |

### Which Prompts Work Where?

**From Our Collections:**

| Collection | Copilot for Enterprise | M365 Copilot |
|------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Quick Start** (50) | ✅ All work | ✅ All work |
| **Power Users** (26) | ⚠️ ~60% work (with upload) | ✅ All work |
| **Outlook** (70) | ⚠️ ~20% work (paste emails first) | ✅ All work |
| **Role-Specific** (203) | ⚠️ ~40% work (upload docs first) | ✅ All work |

**Overall Compatibility:**
- **Copilot for Enterprise:** ~150-200 of 299 advanced prompts work with adaptation
- **M365 Copilot:** All 349 prompts work as written

### How to Know If a Prompt Will Work in Copilot for Enterprise

**🟢 Will work without modification:**
Prompts that say:
- "Based on this document..."
- "Compare these files..."
- "Search SharePoint for..."
- "Analyze the uploaded..."
- "Review these documents..."

**🟡 Will work with adaptation (upload/paste first):**
Prompts that say:
- "Analyze my emails..." → Export & upload email files
- "From my Excel file..." → Upload the Excel file first
- "Based on Teams discussion..." → Paste Teams conversation
- "Summarize documents in [SharePoint folder]..." → Search & upload results

**🔴 Won't work (requires M365 Copilot):**
Prompts that require:
- "Create a PowerPoint presentation..." (can outline, can't create file)
- "Edit this Excel formula..." (can suggest, can't edit directly)
- "Send an email to..." (can draft, can't send)
- Cross-app workflows (Excel → PowerPoint → Outlook in sequence)

### Recommended Approach by Tier

**If you have Copilot for Enterprise (m365.cloud.microsoft):**
- ✅ Use: [Quick Start Guide](prompts/QUICK-START.md) (50 prompts)
- ⚠️ Use: Advanced prompts with **file upload workflow**
  - Export data you need (emails, files, Teams chats)
  - Upload to Copilot for Enterprise
  - Adapt prompt to reference "uploaded documents"
- **Estimated coverage:** 150-200 of our 299 advanced prompts work with adaptation
- **Best for:** Document analysis, research, content creation with organizational knowledge

**If you have M365 Copilot (embedded in Office apps):**
- ✅ Use: **Everything in this repo** (all 349 prompts)
- No adaptation needed - prompts work as written
- Full cross-app workflows enabled
- Automatic data access (no upload required)
- **Best for:** Production workflows, email intelligence, cross-app automation

### How to Identify Which Version You Have

**Copilot for Enterprise:**
- Access via: **m365.cloud.microsoft** (separate website)
- Login with work/school account
- ✅ Can upload files from your computer
- ✅ Can search SharePoint/OneDrive
- ❌ Not embedded in Office apps
- ❌ Can't access Outlook emails automatically

**M365 Copilot:**
- Appears **inside** Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams
- Copilot icon in Office app toolbar/ribbon
- ✅ Can access your data automatically (no upload needed)
- ✅ Edit files directly
- ✅ Send emails, schedule meetings

**Quick Test:**
- Open Outlook → See Copilot icon in toolbar? = **M365 Copilot** ✅
- Only access via m365.cloud.microsoft? = **Copilot for Enterprise** ⚠️

### Why M365 Copilot Works Differently Than ChatGPT

Unlike ChatGPT or standalone AI tools, M365 Copilot is deeply integrated into your work environment:

| Feature | ChatGPT | M365 Copilot |
|---------|---------|--------------|
| **Data Access** | None - you paste content | Full access to your M365 data |
| **Integration** | Standalone chat | Embedded in Office apps |
| **Actions** | Text responses only | Can edit files, send emails, create charts |
| **Context** | Conversation only | Your entire work environment |
| **Workflow** | Copy-paste results | Direct manipulation of your files |

**Generic ChatGPT Prompt:**
```
"Summarize my emails from this week"
```
❌ **Result:** "I don't have access to your emails. Please paste them here."

**M365 Copilot-Optimized Prompt:**
```
"Analyze emails from the last 7 days about the Q2 budget review. 
Create a summary table with: key decisions, action items, blockers, 
and budget impact. Format for my VP."
```
✅ **Result (M365 Copilot):** Accesses Outlook directly, analyzes threads with full context, creates formatted output

**Copilot for Enterprise Prompt:**
```
"I've uploaded 15 emails about Q2 budget review from this week.
Create a summary table with: key decisions, action items, blockers, 
and budget impact. Format for executive audience."
```
✅ **Result (Enterprise):** Analyzes uploaded emails, creates summary (but you had to export emails first)

### M365 Copilot's Unique Capabilities

**✅ What M365 Copilot Can Do (that Enterprise can't):**
- Automatically access emails without export/upload
- Edit Excel files directly (formulas, charts, formatting)
- Create PowerPoint presentations from scratch
- Send emails and schedule meetings
- Real-time cross-app workflows (Excel → PowerPoint → Outlook in one flow)
- Work alongside you in Office apps (no context switching)

**✅ What Both Can Do:**
- Search SharePoint and OneDrive
- Analyze uploaded documents
- Compare multiple files
- Generate summaries and reports
- Answer questions about organizational content

**⚠️ Known Limitations (Both Tiers):**
- Conservative with visual analysis (better to say "I don't know" than guess wrong)
- Limited OCR on complex diagrams, P&IDs, or dense schematics
- No pixel-level precision on images
- Strict confidence thresholds (enterprise-safe execution mode)

**🎯 Bottom Line:**
- **Copilot for Enterprise** = Smart assistant with uploaded documents
- **M365 Copilot** = Embedded productivity tool in your workflow

## 📖 Prompt Engineering Tips

New to Copilot? Here's how to get better results:

### The 4-Question Formula
Transform vague requests into specific prompts:
1. **WHAT** - What exactly do you want? (Be specific)
2. **WHO** - Who is this for? (Audience matters)
3. **WHY** - What's the business context? (Purpose drives output)
4. **HOW LONG** - How detailed? (Scope the response)

**Example:**
❌ "Summarize my emails"  
✅ "Summarize emails from the last 7 days related to the Q1 budget review. I need bullet points for my VP—keep it under 5 key points highlighting any blockers."

### Give Copilot Context
- Reference specific data: "Based on the spreadsheet I just opened..."
- Mention timeframes: "In emails from this month..."
- Specify format: "Create as a table" or "Write as a memo"

### Iterate Don't Restart
If the output isn't right:
- Add constraints: "Make it shorter" or "Focus only on risks"
- Provide examples: "Like the format we used last quarter"
- Correct mistakes: "The deadline is March 15, not May 15"
