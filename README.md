> The definitive Microsoft 365 Copilot prompt library for enterprise professionals. **299 battle-tested prompts** from actual production environments—not generic AI fluff.

**Why this repo exists:** Most AI prompt libraries are generic ChatGPT recycling. This collection focuses exclusively on **Microsoft Copilot** across Office 365 apps, built from real enterprise deployments and proven in production environments.

## 🎯 What Makes This Different

- **Copilot-Specific:** Every prompt optimized for Microsoft Copilot
- **Role-Based:** Organized by job function, not random categories
- **Enterprise-Ready:** Real prompts from production deployments, not theoretical examples
- **Context-Aware:** Each prompt includes use case, target personas, and expected outcomes
- **Zero Fluff:** No "write me a poem about spreadsheets"—these solve actual business problems

## 🤔 Why ChatGPT Prompts Don't Work in Copilot

**Short answer:** Copilot and ChatGPT are fundamentally different tools. Same AI foundation, completely different capabilities.

### Key Differences

| Feature | ChatGPT | Microsoft Copilot |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| **Data Access** | None - you paste content | Full access to your M365 data (emails, files, meetings) |
| **Integration** | Standalone chat | Embedded in Office apps |
| **Actions** | Text responses only | Can edit files, send emails, create charts |
| **Context** | Conversation only | Your entire work environment |
| **Safety Mode** | Exploratory | Enterprise-safe (conservative by design) |

### Why This Matters for Prompts

**Generic ChatGPT Prompt:**
```
"Summarize my emails from this week"
```
❌ **Result:** "I don't have access to your emails. Please paste them here."

**Copilot-Optimized Prompt:**
```
"Analyze emails from the last 7 days about the Q2 budget review. 
Create a summary table with: key decisions, action items, blockers, 
and budget impact. Format for my VP."
```
✅ **Result:** Copilot accesses Outlook directly, analyzes threads with full context, creates formatted output

### Copilot's Strengths & Limitations

**✅ What Copilot Does Well:**
- Compare multiple documents (PDFs, specs, procedures)
- Summarize long technical content
- Cross-reference requirements across files
- Reason over text-heavy documents
- Assist with review, clarification, and consistency checks

**⚠️ Known Limitations (By Design):**
- Conservative with visual analysis (better to say "I don't know" than guess wrong)
- Limited OCR on complex diagrams, P&IDs, or dense schematics
- No pixel-level precision on images
- Strict confidence thresholds (enterprise-safe execution mode)

**🎯 Bottom Line:** Copilot is a production assistant, not an exploratory lab tool. It helps you work faster with your actual data — but humans still validate.

Each prompt is designed to work immediately but customize the placeholders:
- `[TOPIC]` → your specific subject
- `[TIMEFRAME]` → your desired period
- `[METRIC]` → your KPI or measurement

## 📖 Prompt Engineering Tips

New to Copilot? Here's how to get better results:

### The 4-Question Formula
Transform vague requests into specific prompts:
1. **WHAT** - What exactly do you want? (Be specific)
2. **WHO** - Who is this for? (Audience matters)
3. **WHY** - What's the business context? (Purpose drives output)
4. **HOW LONG** - How detailed? (Scope the response)

**Example:**
❌ "Summarize my emails"  
✅ "Summarize emails from the last 7 days related to the Q1 budget review. I need bullet points for my VP—keep it under 5 key points highlighting any blockers."

### Give Copilot Context
- Reference specific data: "Based on the spreadsheet I just opened..."
- Mention timeframes: "In emails from this month..."
- Specify format: "Create as a table" or "Write as a memo"

### Iterate Don't Restart
If the output isn't right:
- Add constraints: "Make it shorter" or "Focus only on risks"
- Provide examples: "Like the format we used last quarter"
- Correct mistakes: "The deadline is March 15, not May 15"
